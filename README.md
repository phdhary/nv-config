# NvChad Personal Configuration

NvChad is awesome base for Neovim config.

This repository is my custom configuration of it.

In case that you'd like to try this:

- Install Neovim.
- In shell run:

```
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1;
git clone https://github.com/phdhary/nv-config.git ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom --depth 1;
nvim;
```
