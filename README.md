# NvChad Personal Configuration

NvChad is awesome base for Neovim config.

This repository is my custom configuration of it.

In case that you'd like to try this:
- Install Neovim.
- Follow [NvChad](https://nvchad.github.io/quickstart/install#pre-requisites)'s instruction .
- Clone this repository to `{nvim config directory}/lua/custom/`.
- Do a PackerSync.
